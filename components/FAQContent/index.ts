    question: "How could a one-size-fits-all approach work?",

    answer: [
      `Through the OneTrak Dashboard, you'll begin seeing quantifiable results after one to two months.

        The OneTrak Dashboard launched in 2019 for OneTrak customers. This was based on the existing MyDairyDashboard. The OneTrak Dashboard uses this foundation, but we built additional “cards” for areas such as nutrient deviation and batch times.
        
        The goal of this dashboard is first to offer added value to our customers. The dashboard tracks important metrics, helping them make smarter and more profitable decisions. For our team, it represents a useful tool to more deeply advise our customers and help analyze causes of issues, or to simply help them see the value of using OneTrak from different metrics.

      `We don't charge our customers for access to the dashboard, or to get set up. It’s free to them. So even if they aren't sure if they'll use it, we encourage them to just get set up and trained. If they just don’t have the time or feel intimidated, our team will help bring them insights with periodic reports and use the dashboard to help analyze issues on farm.

    question: "Don't I need starch to get enough energy into the animal?",

    question:
      "I (nutritionist) can get more energy into the animal than Sweet Bran",
    answer: [
      "It is not about the energy you can calculate on the formulation sheet. It is about energy that can be consumed and effectively used by the animal - and that's where Sweet Bran wins. Because we displace a portion of the starch in the diet with digestible fiber and steep, we reduce the negative impacts of high starch diets for the rumen. This means rumen pH is more stable and this translates to greater intake over time as they are not frequently in an acidotic state. AND it means that more microbes are present in the rumen to digest the entire diet so they are utilizing more energy.",

    question:
      "This is just wet corn gluten feed wrapped in a brand name and premium price",
    answer: [
      "Sweet Bran is not a by-product. It is designed with the needs of the animal in mind for the greatest impact of rumen health and increased energy. There is a proprietary combination of digestible corn bran and nutrient-rich steep from the wet milling stream. We have comprehensive quality management processes in place to manage our ingredients as they are produced and stored.  We batch mix each load to a purposeful formulation to maintain consistent quality and nutrient results.",

    question:
      "You are not flexible enough… we need to be able to make fast ration changes to be price competitive.",
    answer: [
      "We produce hundreds of semi loads of feed daily at our manufacturing locations in 15-30 ton batches.  Because of the volume and speed of our feed manufacturing we have unique equipment and systems.  This limits the number of ingredients we can cost effectively and efficiently handle.  We have formal processes in place to vet our ingredient suppliers and to receive new ingredients to our manufacturing locations.   We have multiple systems in place to ensure the correct ingredients are included at the right levels in the product and that product goes to the right customer with correct and accurate documentation.  Because of these multiple systems, and our tight controls, we have formal change processes to adjust formulations that takes time to execute.",
      "We produce millions of tons annually and we maintain a sold out position.  We ensure our customers a reliable supply of feed for their animals.  In return, we need steady and reliable demand, so we need customers to maintain relatively consistent usage levels in order for us to keep that capacity available to them.",

    question:
      "You are too expensive to price into the ration, we like to feed all on farm ingredients.",
    answer: [
      "We strive to price our products at a point that is fair for the long term for our customers and for our business.  Our products are priced based on the value they create for our customers.  Yes, sometimes a cheaper alternative may exist vs. utilizing our products, but that doesn’t mean it will result in lower cost animal performance or improved profitability.  We firmly believe our products are priced such that our customers are more profitable with our products vs. without.",

    question:
      "Yard Manager seeing cattle get to the bunk but also seeing diarrhea or “loose” and nutritionist says this is a problem",
    answer: [
      "RAMP is comprised of highly digestible Sweet Bran and has some roughage to fulfill the scratch factor needs of the rumen.  However this complete starter is not as bulky as traditional starters that contain a majority of hay.  This increases the passage rate of the feed through the animal, resulting in a more loose stool.  This nothing to be concerned with as long as cattle are coming to the bunk to eat and have been provided ample feed.  Allowing cattle to slick on RAMP will create some inopportunity among the pen, and opportunity for over eating when they get the chance again.",
    ],
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    question: "It's too expensive, I can make my own starter cheaper.",
    answer: [
      "RAMP is not just a sound energy dense product but also has a hassle free service experience.  There is less demand on the mill to handle bulky roughages, increases throughput through the mill for operational efficiency.  RAMP has a high energy value and entices cattle to eat quickly upon hitting the bunk.  Nutrition is essential for cattle upon entering the feedyard due to all the stress and new environment they are exposed to.  RAMP is specifically designed and formulated to allow cattle to consume feed quickly to combat these factors.",

    id: 14,
    question: "It's not flexible enough with the type of cattle I feed.",
    answer: [
      "RAMP was designed to get cattle onto feed quickly and transition them onto the finish diet without disruptions.  RAMP has been used to grow cattle, start cattle on finisher within 4 days, and many other facets.  RAMP was designed to start cattle and transition them onto a finisher but over the evolution of our customer base and the cattle industry RAMP has been used and been successful across many types of cattle.",

  {
    id: 15,
    question:
      "RAMP does not have the energy value that we say it has… safe energy but low energy.",
    answer: [
      "Cattle consume RAMP at a rate of 3% of bodyweight and has been shown to contribute to gain at 3-4 lbs ADG.  On an 600 lb steer that is a conversion of 5.1 on a starter diet (600*.03 = 18 lbs DMI /3.5lbs ADG = 5.1 feed conversion).  There is also the aspect of increased energy intake due to rumen health attributes.  Cattle on RAMP change the way they consume feed, they start to eat more smaller meals throughout the day and night.  This provides a more even production of energy within the animal over the day and night allowing for more intake compared to other rations.",
    ],

  {
    id: 16,
    question: "I want to feed bunk hay with RAMP or add other ingredients in.",
    answer: [
      "RAMP has all the cattle need to get to the bunk and start eating.  We provide protein, roughage, energy, and all vitamins and minerals cattle need for optimal growth and performance.  Additional ingredients may act counter productive to what RAMP was designed to do, by either diluting it or decreasing the effectiveness of the ingredients already in there.",
